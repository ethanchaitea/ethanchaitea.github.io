                <h2>Hi! My name's Ethan Chai.</h2>
                <p>I'm a student, software engineer, and a creative thinker who wants to create solutions for everyday issues.</p>
                <p>I'm rising sophomore studying CS at the University of California, Riverside, and am looking to concentrate in software development. I enjoy coding in a multitude of languages, and have a vested interest in creating software that serves its users in a satisfying and novel way.</p>
                <p>Outside of the field of CS, I enjoy sports such as basketball and volleyball, video games, VALORANT and Madden among them, listening to music (GIVĒON's #1 fan), traveling, trying new foods and matcha spots, and spending quality time with my family and friends.</p>
                <h2>So why coding?</h2>
                <p>Since my childhood, I've had a fascination with technology and its inner workings. The first time I accidentally opened the Chrome dev tools, I felt as though I had unearthed an ancient scroll containing the mysteries of the universe. Of course, I didn't understand a lick of code, so I made it my mission to try and interpret the cogs and wheels that made my technology run.</p>
                <h2>Want the technical details?</h2>
                <p>Silly question; if you're reading this, chances are you're a recruiter. My résumé is available <a href="">here.</a></p>
